# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone is successfully controlling the motors with Python code and setting up the Pi Camera. I took a few photos to test the Pi Camera and its connection. I inputted the GPIO pins that were connected to the motors into the python script and ran a test where the wheels would move forward, backwards, left, and right. This test was important because it showed me that my motor code was working correctly and that the connections from the solder to the h bridge to the raspberry pi were all correct. A challenge I faced during my second milestone was attatching the Pi Camera to the front of the car; since my first protoype had the Raspberry Pi at the back, the Pi Camera could not reach the front of the car. I then detached the battery pack in the front of the car and moved my Raspberry Pi to the front of the car. There were also a lot of issues with the motor wires falling out of the screw terminals.

# First Milestone
  
My first milestone was setting up the raspberry pi and building the robot. I wrote the microSD card with Raspberry imager and added extra files in order to successfully complete a headless startup when connected. When conneceted to power with the microSD plugged in, I was able to connect to the Raspberry Pi through Putty and then display the Raspberry Pi screen through VNC Viewer. The second step was to build my robot car. I started by learning how to solder from an instructor, then, I soldered the wires onto the motors and attatched it to the base. After attaching all 3 wheels, I connected the motor wires to the H bridge screw terminals and connected the H bridge to the Raspberry Pi gpio pins. This allows code in the Raspberry Pi to move the car.
